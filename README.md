## ‚ùì What is Hacktoberfest 2020?

Hacktoberfest 2020 is a month long virtual festival event to celebrate open source contributions presented by Digital Ocean, in partnership with Intel and DEV. It is the easiest way to get into open source!

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)

During the entire month of October 2020, all you have to do is contribute to any open source projects and open at least 4 pull requests. Yes, any project and any kind of contributions. You don‚Äôt need to be an expert in programming or coding. It can be a be a bug fix, improvement, or even a documentation change! And win an awesome T-shirt and awesome stickers.

- Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!
- Four quality pull requests must be submitted to public GitHub repositories.
- You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.
- To qualify for the official limited edition Hacktoberfest shirt, you must register and make four pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone). PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest.
- If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the project‚Äôs code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.

This is the repository for Hacktoberfest 2020 Meetup at NITK Surathkal organized by [Web Enthusiasts' Club NITK](https://github.com/WebClub-NITK), [IEEE NITK](https://github.com/IEEE-NITK) and [HackVerse NITK](https://hackverse.nitk.ac.in/).

## üòï Why Should I Contribute?

The Hacktoberfest‚Äôs simple plain objective is:

    Support open source and earn a limited edition T-shirt!

But, it‚Äôs not just about the t-shirts or stickers. Its about supporting open source. Its about celebrating open source, and giving it back. If you‚Äôve never contributed to open source before, this is the perfect time to get started because Hacktoberfest provides a large list of available contribution opportunities (and yes, there are always plenty for beginners too).


## üëå What Can I Contribute?

Hacktoberfest¬Æ is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you‚Äôre a developer, student learning to code, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.

It doesn‚Äôt need to be code. It can be even documentation. Or spelling fix.

You can contribute to any open source project hosted on Github.com and contribute anything between October 1 to October 31 midnight in 2020. You will find plenty of issues labeled with hacktoberfest or good-first-issue etc on Github. These will be the simple ones most probably and easy to fix.
